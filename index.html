								<b>Student Consultant: Pretecor's Market Entry Strategy</b>
								<br> 
								&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Upon my team and me arriving in Colombia, we conducted a three phased approach of Research, Analysis, and Implimentation due to our limited time with the client.
								Our first week consisted of over 20 informational interviews with stakeholders from C-Suit to Governmental agencies to establish both trust and understanding of the challenge.
								Upon digesting the information we collected, we spent the second week evaluating our findings, refined questions and began brainstorming upon opportunities.
								Our final week on the ground ended in a mid-point deliverable providing insight and direction to the client ensuring our path was laid out for when we returned to the U.S.
								In our remaining three weeks back home, we finalized strategies for: International Trade, Operations, Marketing, Customer's Digital Journey, Client Lists, and Legal Regulations that we foresaw as hurdles and required adaptations.

								<br>
								&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From a cohort of 64 focusing on various SDG's, our 8 person sub-cohort was tasked with the goal Life on Land. Each member
								responsible for an individual deliverable with frequent cross over of data sharing. My deliverable focused on mapping all 27 ecotopes in the City of L.A. and attributing them 
								to a search function with the input feature being zip code. The purpose was to provide a credible data base backed by environmental scientists to encourage businesses & home owners to move away from importing 
								invasive species. My contribution to this project established the foundation of the thousands of rows of database entry, customer journey mapping & the search processing theory for a future cohort to build it into the web.

								<b>Student Consultant: Early Warning Services MR & <a href="Zelle group payment service.png">Product Development</a></b>
								<br>
								&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My undergraduate capstone project was my first exposure to consulting outside of a classroom case study. 
								Our four person team was tasked with a staged process of researching the Peer-to-Peer payment industry, data aggregation companies, and data privacy laws within the United States. 
								The projects primary metric for success was establishing a baseline of pricing models of competitors in the data aggregation industry. Secondary metric for success was researching regulations of GDPR
								and categorizing the risk for EWS and competitors of the potential federal level adoption in the U.S. Lastly, but not least, was a creative journey that I experimented with in expanding the 
								product offerings on their Zelle P2P platform from only 'Pay' and 'Request' features to a 'Group Payment' or 'Split' option for consumers to click. This side project was intended to 
								keep Zelle competitive amongst players like Venmo and CashApp who had a larger piece of the millenial and zoomer generations. I learned how to use Adobe XD to establish the customer 
								journey from establishing the payment to splitting various bills within a hypothetical boating trip. The UI of the customer journey can be found <a href="Zelle group payment service.png">HERE</a>.
								This 'beta' experimentation eventually made it into a working feature in the Zelle service that can be seen today which I find incredibly rewarding to have been a part of.
